# Perlin Noise Playground

This code is my playground for playing around with Perlin Noise generation using the P5.js library. 

I've been following the [Perlin Noise video series](https://youtu.be/y7sgcFhk6ZM?si=4nh0V3Cv1FBQLXt_) by ["The Coding Train"](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) on Youtube.
